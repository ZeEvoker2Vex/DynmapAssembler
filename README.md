# DynmapAssembler
A simple program that assemble all PNGs generated by a dynmap plugin to two big PNGs (dynmap scale and 1px=1block scale).


Usage :

To use, copy "dynmap/web/tiles/world/flat" folder in a "map" folder which must be in the same directory that the executable.
Now, just run it !

The program will generate 2 PNG : the first one named "map.png" is simply the map at the scale of the dynmap, i.e. 4x4 pixels = 1 block. The second one named "map-resize.png" is the map at the scale 1 pixel = 1 block.

One problem is that the program will generate too big a map because the dynmap will have generated a part of the map that is far from the rest, and that you are not interested in.
You will have to crop the png to keep what you are interested in. So be patient, it should not take more than 5 minutes : 40960x22400 takes 3m40s for me.


Requirements :

Just make sure you have Visual C++ Redistributable before running the program.
